# RYGO — Game Design Document

> **Brand:** RYGO (locked May 2, 2026 — was codename "Yergers")
> **Tagline:** Minimalist daily logic-constraints puzzle at [playRYGO.com](<http://playRYGO.com>)
> **Status:** v1.5 — MVP scope (May 2, 2026: brand integration; brand palette adopted as game-content colors)
> **Last updated:** May 2, 2026

## Concept

A daily logic puzzle where the player recreates a target color pattern on a grid using three colors with different placement behaviors. Performance is measured by efficiency (moves) with time as tiebreaker. The player must memorize the pattern — they can never view the pattern and the playable board simultaneously.

## Brand identity (locked May 2, 2026)

The codename "Yergers" was a placeholder during development. Final brand: **RYGO**.

## Components

### Grid

A square grid of configurable size. Player chooses difficulty at start:

* **Easy:** 4×4 (16 cells)
* **Normal:** 5×5 (25 cells)
* **Hard:** 6×6 (36 cells)
* **Extreme:** 8×8 (64 cells)

The 4 / 5 / 6 ramp gives a smooth working-memory progression. 8×8 is the heroic tier — past the typical working-memory limit, intended for players who want a serious test rather than a daily ritual.

### Colors and shapes

Three colors, each paired with a distinct shape so the game is fully playable for color-blind users. **Color and shape together identify a cell's state. Shape is not optional.** Game-content colors (red, yellow, green) and their shape fills are **identical in light and dark mode**. Game-content colors **match the RYGO brand palette** (locked v1.5).

| State    | Color (background)                    | Shape (centered, \~50% of cell)   | Shape fill      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 🔴 Red    | `#D8463A` (RYGO Red)                  | Square                            | Paper `#F5F3EE` |
| 🟡 Yellow | `#E6B73B` (RYGO Yellow)               | Triangle, apex up (yield/caution) | Ink `#14110E`   |
| 🟢 Green  | `#2E9D5C` (RYGO Green)                | Circle (go light)                 | Paper `#F5F3EE` |
| Empty    | Theme-dependent — see Theming section | None                              | —               |

**Rationale for shape choice:** red-green color blindness (deuteranopia / protanopia) affects \~5–8% of men. Without shape differentiation, those players cannot tell red and green cells apart at all, making the game unplayable. The traffic-light metaphor that motivated the color choice is preserved and reinforced by the shapes — every cell now reads as a tiny road sign. Square was chosen for red (over the original octagon) because it is maximally distinct from circle at small sizes — pure 90° corners, no curves.

**Rationale for using brand palette as game palette:** the RYGO brand was designed *with these colors as the colors*. The previous Tailwind starting values (`red-600` / `amber-400` / `green-600`) were placeholders explicitly noted as "tune for harmony." The brand palette is the tuning. Adopting it preserves visual consistency across logo, marketing, and gameplay. WCAG AA contrast is preserved: Paper `#F5F3EE` on RYGO Red `#D8463A` ≈ 4.6:1; Ink `#14110E` on RYGO Yellow `#E6B73B` ≈ 11.3:1; Paper on RYGO Green ≈ 4.4:1 — all clear the 3:1 minimum for graphical objects.

### Cells

Each cell holds one of four states: `empty`, `red`, `yellow`, or `green`. Empty cells render as a theme-dependent neutral with no shape. Colored cells render as the colored background with the corresponding shape centered.

In a generated target pattern, **every cell is colored** — no cell is empty in the target. Empty cells appear only on the playable board during play, and only transiently (you can clear cells to recover from misplays).

### Pattern display

A view of the target pattern, shown only when the player explicitly reveals it. Hidden by default during gameplay. The playable board and the pattern display are **never visible at the same time**.

When transitioning between the pattern view and the playable board (in either direction), a 1-second blank "Get ready..." screen is shown to prevent rapid-fire bouncing between views as a memorization shortcut. The timer continues to run during the blank screen; the blank is not a free pause.

### Move counter

Increments on **every meaningful click**. See the Scoring section for the full rules.

### Timer

Starts on the first pattern reveal. Runs continuously until the player completes the puzzle, including during the 1-second pattern↔board transition blanks. Cannot be paused.

## Rules

### Color reach

When a color is placed at a target cell, it attempts to fill cells according to its reach pattern. All reach patterns are **orthogonal only** (no diagonals).

* **Red at X** → attempts to fill only X. (1 cell)
* **Yellow at X** → attempts to fill X plus the four orthogonally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right), clipped to grid bounds. (3–5 cells depending on position)
* **Green at X** → attempts to fill X, then propagates outward in each of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). Propagation in a given direction stops at the first non-empty cell or the edge of the grid. **Non-empty cells block green's reach** — they are not overwritten and they prevent green from reaching cells beyond them.

### Blocking (green only)

Red has 1-cell reach, so blocking is moot. Yellow has 1-cell-radius reach (the plus shape), so its only "beyond" cells don't exist. **Only green is affected by blocking.**

Example on a 4×4 grid:

```
.  .  .  .
.  R  .  .       (R = red at row 1, col 1)
.  .  .  .
.  .  .  .
```

Placing green at row 0, col 0 (top-left, no blockers in row or col):

```
G  G  G  G       row 0: green propagates from col 0 — full row fills
G  R  .  .       col 0: green propagates down — full column fills
G  .  .  .
G  .  .  .
```

Placing green at row 1, col 0:

```
.  .  .  .
G  R  .  .       row 1: green propagates right, hits R at col 1, stops; col 2 and 3 stay empty
G  .  .  .       col 0: green propagates up + down — full column
G  .  .  .
G  .  .  .
```

The R at (1, 1) blocks green's eastward propagation in row 1. Cells (1, 2) and (1, 3) remain empty.

This makes intervening colors a meaningful design tool — placing green first then layering red on top is fundamentally different from placing red first then attempting green.

### Overwrite hierarchy

When a color attempts to fill a cell, the existing state of that cell determines whether the fill takes effect:

| Placing ↓ \\ Existing → | Empty   | Green                                         | Yellow                                        | Red                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Red**                 | ✅ fills | ✅ overwrites                                  | ✅ overwrites                                  | ✅ overwrites                                  |
| **Yellow**              | ✅ fills | ✅ overwrites                                  | ❌ no change                                   | ❌ no change                                   |
| **Green**               | ✅ fills | ❌ no change (also blocks further propagation) | ❌ no change (also blocks further propagation) | ❌ no change (also blocks further propagation) |

In short:

* **Red** dominates everything.
* **Yellow** beats green only.
* **Green** is passive — only fills empty cells, and is blocked by anything non-empty.

### Clearing (same-color tap)

When the active color matches the color of the tapped cell, the tap **clears** rather than places. Clearing follows the same reach pattern and the same blocking rules as placement, with these specifics:

* **Red active, tap a red cell:** that single cell is cleared to empty. (1 cell)
* **Yellow active, tap a yellow cell:** that cell plus any of the four orthogonal neighbors that are also yellow are cleared to empty. Mixed-color neighbors are not affected.
* **Green active, tap a green cell:** that cell plus all green cells reachable via green's propagation rule (cardinal directions, blocked by any non-green cell) are cleared to empty.

### Pattern generation

* Patterns are generated by a date-seeded RNG so all players see the same daily puzzle.
* Every generated pattern must be **provably solvable** under these rules — there must exist at least one sequence of color placements that produces the target.
* Solvability is verified by construction: the generator produces a solution sequence first, then derives the target pattern by simulating that sequence on an empty board.
* **Full coverage required:** every cell in the target is colored (no empty cells in any generated target). The generator extends the solution sequence as needed until full coverage is reached.
* **All three colors required:** every generated target uses red, yellow, AND green. A target with only two colors is rejected and regenerated.
* **Trivial-puzzle rejection** (pre-existing): rejects all-one-color and >85%-single-color targets, and rejects targets where the first move alone produces the target.
* Generated patterns target a solution length appropriate to grid size. Concrete ranges to be retuned when the new generator (full coverage + all three colors) is implemented; expect longer solutions than v1.3 because covering every cell typically requires more moves than the previous "fill some cells" approach.

## Gameplay

### Setup

1. Player loads the game and selects grid size (Easy / Normal / Hard / Extreme).
2. The board appears empty, with a **Reveal Pattern** button visible.

### First reveal (free move)

3. Player taps **Reveal Pattern**. After a 1-second "Get ready..." blank, the target pattern displays.
4. **The timer starts** on this first reveal.
5. **The first reveal does not count as a move.** The move counter starts at zero.

### Solving loop

 6. Player taps **Hide / Start Solving**. After a 1-second "Get ready..." blank, the empty playable board appears.
 7. Player taps a color in the color picker to make it active.
 8. Player taps cells. Each tap places the active color at that cell (or clears, if the cell already holds the active color). Placement follows the reach, blocking, and overwrite rules. Clearing follows the reach and blocking rules and only clears matching-color cells.
 9. Player can switch active color at any time by tapping a different color in the picker.
10. While a color is active, tapping multiple cells in sequence places (or clears) at each cell — no need to re-select between taps.

### Re-reveal (penalized)

11. Player can re-reveal the pattern at any time by tapping **Reveal Pattern**. The 1-second blank applies, then the pattern is shown. The playable board is hidden during this time. **Each re-reveal costs one move** (the first reveal is the only free one; every subsequent reveal counts).

### Completion

12. The system continuously checks whether the playable board matches the target pattern.
13. **Auto-detection:** as soon as the boards match exactly, the timer stops and the player enters a brief **validation sequence** (see below).
14. The end-of-game summary shows: score (moves), time, and grid size.

### Validation sequence (locked v1.5)

When the board matches the target, the game does NOT immediately swap to the summary screen. The current "ripped away from you" abrupt-cut is a bug. Instead:

* The timer freezes at the exact moment the boards matched (no extra ms charged).
* A \~750–1000ms validation sweep plays — a row-by-row pulse that gives the player a sense of "yes, you did it" without forcing them to read a popup.
* The RYGO mark in the chrome flips to a solid, glowing-green state to signal success.
* After the sweep completes, the Summary card replaces the GameScreen.

The architectural shape: a new `'validating'` GamePhase between `'playing'` and `'complete'`. The timer freeze happens in the reducer; the visual sweep is a UI-layer animation gated on phase. The full spec lives in [TER-153](https://linear.app/terenc/issue/TER-153/win-state-validation-sequence-validating-gamephase-row-pulse-mark-glow).

### Constraints during play

* The pattern and the playable board are **never visible at the same time**.
* The 1-second transition blank applies in both directions (board → pattern, pattern → board) and the timer keeps running through it.
* The timer never pauses once started.
* The first reveal is free; every subsequent reveal counts as one move.
* All other meaningful clicks count — see Scoring.

## Scoring

**Moves are the score. Time is the tiebreaker.**

This makes the game a routing problem: minimize total clicks to reach the target. Time still creates light tension during play, but optimal play is purely about move efficiency.

### What counts as a move

* **Placement** (tapping an empty/non-matching cell with a color active) — 1 move
* **Clearing** (tapping a matching-color cell with that color active) — 1 move
* **Color switch to a *different* color** in the picker — 1 move
* **Color tap that does not change state** (tapping the already-active color) — 0 moves (no-op visually, no charge)
* **Re-reveal of pattern** (after the first) — 1 move
* **Hide pattern** (returning to the playable board) — 1 move
* **First reveal** — 0 moves (free)

The "every meaningful click costs" rule means efficient solving requires minimizing color switches and minimizing re-reveals, not just minimizing placements. A solution that places 12 colors with 2 switches scores 14; a solution that places 12 colors with 5 switches scores 17.

### Display

* The game-screen status bar shows **Score** (move count) as the primary metric and time as supporting context.
* The end-of-game summary shows score prominently, with time underneath.
* No combined formula. Time is purely tiebreaker for any leaderboard or aggregate; it never enters the score itself.

## UX constraints

The product is **mobile-first**. These are acceptance criteria, not stretch goals:

* Designed for portrait phone screens first; desktop is a graceful upscale.
* Touch-optimized hit targets — color picker buttons and grid cells minimum 44×44pt (Apple HIG). Cell size at 8×8 on iPhone SE is \~43px, marginally below the target — accepted tradeoff.
* No hover states as primary affordances. Everything works on tap.
* Snappy feedback — placement render under 100ms, plus a subtle scale-down on press to make the click feel intentional ([TER-148](https://linear.app/terenc/issue/TER-148/game-screen-ux-cleanup-remove-quit-dialog-add-restart-fix-light-mode)).
* 60fps target on mid-range phones for any cascade animations.
* Safe areas respected (notches, home indicator).

## Theming (MVP)

The game ships with **two themes: dark (default) and light**. Users can toggle between them, and their choice persists across sessions.

### Decisions

* **Default theme: dark.** First-time visitors land in dark mode regardless of OS preference. Respecting `prefers-color-scheme` is deferred — keeps the implementation simple and gives every new player the same first impression.
* **Toggle UI:** a small theme-toggle button visible on every screen, in a corner. Icon-based (sun for "switch to light," moon for "switch to dark"). The icon shown represents *the theme the user would switch to*, not the current theme — convention.
* **Persistence:** the user's choice is saved in `localStorage` under the key `rygo:theme` with values `'dark'` or `'light'`. On load, the persisted value (if any) wins over the default. (Migration from `yergers:theme` happens in [TER-151](https://linear.app/terenc/issue/TER-151/yergers-rygo-rebrand-rename-brand-asset-wiring-lockup-localstorage).)
* **Implementation:** Tailwind v4 class-based dark mode via `@custom-variant dark`. The `dark` class is applied to `<html>` when dark theme is active, removed when light theme is active.
* **Game-content colors are theme-invariant.** Red, yellow, green, and their shape fills do not change between modes. The traffic-light metaphor is preserved.
* **Surface palette uses brand Ink/Paper:**
  * Light mode page background: Paper `#F5F3EE`
  * Dark mode page background: Ink `#14110E`
  * Light mode primary text: Ink
  * Dark mode primary text: Paper
* **Theme-dependent surfaces:** page background, page text, secondary text, empty cells, borders, button backgrounds, status bar, **active-color indicator on the color picker** (must be visible in both themes — a contrasting hue, not a white ring that disappears against Paper).

## Accessibility (MVP requirement, not polish)

* **Shape + color, never color alone.** Every non-empty cell renders both its background color and its shape. The shape is the primary identifier for color-blind users; color is secondary.
* **Color picker buttons** also display the shape, in addition to the color, so the active-color indicator is meaningful for color-blind users.
* **Contrast.** Shape fill color must contrast against the background color at WCAG AA 3:1 minimum for graphical objects in both light and dark modes. The brand-palette shape fills (Paper on RYGO Red, Ink on RYGO Yellow, Paper on RYGO Green) all clear this bar.
* **Screen reader labels.** Each cell has an `aria-label` describing its state (e.g., "Red cell at row 2, column 3" or "Empty cell at row 1, column 1"). The color picker buttons have labels like "Select red" / "Select yellow" / "Select green." The theme toggle has a label like "Switch to light theme" / "Switch to dark theme" reflecting the action it would take.
* **No reliance on color alone for any state indicator** anywhere in the UI (active color, completion state, etc.).

## Open questions (deferred from this doc)

These are flagged but not blocking. We'll address each before the relevant feature ships.

1. **Daily-only vs. unlimited.** Daily lock per level is the M3 default; "practice mode" lets players replay an already-completed daily without recording a score. See [TER-142](https://linear.app/terenc/issue/TER-142/daily-play-tracking-once-per-day-lock-localstorage-foundation).
2. **Tutorial / first-run experience.** How does a brand-new player learn the rules? Probably an interactive first puzzle. Defer to polish (M4).
3. **Sound design.** Defer to polish (M4); could add a lot of feel but not MVP-critical. Design intent locked: percussive wooden tap on placement, three-note R-Y-G ascending chime on completion.
4. **Animations.** Cell fill cascades, color transitions, completion celebration. Defer to polish (M4) except the validation sweep which is M2 ([TER-153](https://linear.app/terenc/issue/TER-153/win-state-validation-sequence-validating-gamephase-row-pulse-mark-glow)).
5. **Respect** `prefers-color-scheme` on first visit. Currently: dark default for everyone. Could revisit if users complain.
6. **Pattern generator solution-length ranges** — to be retuned when full-coverage generation lands ([TER-146](https://linear.app/terenc/issue/TER-146/generator-full-coverage-all-3-colors-required-retune)). Real-play data will guide final ranges.

## Changelog

Adopted brand color palette as game-content colors (RYGO Red `#D8463A`, RYGO Yellow `#E6B73B`, RYGO Green `#2E9D5C`); shape fills changed to Paper / Ink. Page surface palette adopts Ink (dark) / Paper (light) instead of Tailwind gray-950 / white. Locked validation sequence between completion and summary — abrupt-cut bug. localStorage key `yergers:theme` → `rygo:theme` (migration in [TER-151](https://linear.app/terenc/issue/TER-151/yergers-rygo-rebrand-rename-brand-asset-wiring-lockup-localstorage)).
